Deployer
========

Atomic deployments with bash script.

Installing
----------

You just have to clone the repository into some directory, like:

    git clone git@github.com:henriquemoody/deployer.git /usr/local/deployer

To create a global link of the `deploy` script just run `make install`, like:
    
    cd /usr/local/deployer
    make install
